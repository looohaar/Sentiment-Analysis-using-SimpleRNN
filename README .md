# Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on the IMDb dataset. The IMDb dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews categorized into positive and negative sentiment labels.

## Future Work
Potential improvements or extensions to the project, like using more advanced RNN architectures (LSTM, GRU), fine-tuning hyperparameters, or experimenting with different embeddings.
